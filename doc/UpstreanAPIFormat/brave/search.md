## Use Cases

Web Search is perfect for:

- **Search Applications**: Build custom search experiences for your users
- **Content Aggregation**: Gather information from multiple web sources
- **Market Research**: Track mentions, trends, and competitor activity
- **Data Enrichment**: Supplement your data with web-sourced information

## Freshness Filtering

Web Search offers powerful date-based filtering to help you find the most relevant content:

- **Last 24 Hours** (`pd`): Get the latest updates and recent content
- **Last 7 Days** (`pw`): Track weekly trends and recent discussions
- **Last 31 Days** (`pm`): Monitor monthly developments
- **Last Year** (`py`): Search content from the past year
- **Custom Date Range**: Specify exact timeframes (e.g., `2022-04-01to2022-07-30`)

Example request filtering for web pages from the past week:

```bash
curl "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=machine+learning+tutorials&freshness=pw" \
  -H "X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

## Country and Language Targeting

Customize your web search results by specifying:

- **Country**: Target results from specific countries using 2-character country codes
- **Search Language**: Filter results by content language
- **UI Language**: Set the preferred language for response metadata

Example request for German content from Germany:

```bash
curl "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=nachhaltige+energie&country=DE&search_lang=de" \
  -H "X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

## Extra Snippets

The extra snippets feature provides up to 5 additional excerpts per search result, giving you more context from each web page. This is particularly useful for:

- Comprehensive content preview before clicking through
- Better relevance assessment for search applications
- Enhanced user experience with richer result cards

To enable extra snippets, add the `extra_snippets` query parameter set to `true`:

```bash
curl "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=python+web+frameworks&extra_snippets=true" \
  -H "X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

When enabled, each result in the `web.results` array will include an additional `extra_snippets` property containing an array of alternative excerpts:

```json
{
  "web": {
    "results": [
      {
        "title": "Python Web Frameworks",
        "url": "https://example.com/python-frameworks",
        "description": "Main snippet text...",
        "extra_snippets": [
          "First additional excerpt from the page...",
          "Second additional excerpt from the page...",
          "Third additional excerpt from the page..."
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Goggles Support

Web Search supports [Goggles](/documentation/resources/goggles), which allow you to apply custom re-ranking on top of search results. You can:

- Boost or demote specific websites and domains
- Filter by custom criteria
- Create personalized ranking algorithms

Goggles can be provided as a URL or inline definition, and multiple goggles can be combined.

## Search Operators

Web Search supports [search operators](/documentation/resources/search-operators) to refine your queries. These operators are included directly within the `q` query parameter itself, not as separate API parameters:

- Use quotes for exact phrase matching: `"climate change solutions"`
- Exclude terms with minus: `javascript -jquery`
- Site-specific searches: `site:github.com rust tutorials`
- File type searches: `filetype:pdf machine learning`

For example, to search for PDF files about machine learning:

```bash
curl "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=machine+learning+filetype:pdf" \
  -H "X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

## Pagination

Efficiently paginate through web search results:

- **count**: Maximum number of results per page (max 20, default 20). The actual number of results returned may be less than `count`.
- **offset**: Starting position for results (0-based, max 9)

Example request for page 2 with up to 20 results per page:

```bash
curl "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=open+source+projects&count=20&offset=1" \
  -H "X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

### Best Practice: Check `more_results_available`

Rather than blindly iterating with increasing offset values, check the `more_results_available` field in the response to determine if additional pages exist. This field is located in the `query` object of the response:

```json
{
  "query": {
    "original": "open source projects",
    "more_results_available": true
  }
}
```

Only request the next page if `more_results_available` is `true`. This prevents unnecessary API calls when no more results are available.

## Safe Search

Control adult content filtering with the `safesearch` parameter:

- **off**: No filtering
- **moderate**: Filter explicit content (default)
- **strict**: Filter explicit and suggestive content

## Local enrichments

Local enrichments provide extra information about places of interest (POI), such as images and the websites where the POI is mentioned. The Local Search API is a **separate endpoint** from Web Search, requiring a two-step process (similar to the Summarizer API).

### Step 1: Query Web Search for Locations

First, make a request to the web search endpoint with a location-based query:

```bash
curl "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=greek+restaurants+in+san+francisco" \
  -H "X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

If the query returns a list of locations, each location result includes an `id` field — a temporary identifier that can be used to retrieve extra information:

```json
{
  "locations": {
    "results": [
      {
        "id": "1520066f3f39496780c5931d9f7b26a6",
        "title": "Pangea Banquet Mediterranean Food",
        ...
      },
      {
        "id": "d00b153c719a427ea515f9eacf4853a2",
        "title": "Park Mediterranean Grill",
        ...
      },
      {
        "id": "4b943b378725432aa29f019def0f0154",
        "title": "The Halal Mediterranean Co.",
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Fetch Local POI Details

Use the `id` values to fetch detailed POI information from the Local Search API endpoints. The `ids` query parameter accepts up to 20 location IDs:

```bash
curl "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/local/pois?ids=1520066f3f39496780c5931d9f7b26a6&ids=d00b153c719a427ea515f9eacf4853a2" \
  -H "X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

To fetch AI-generated descriptions for locations:

```bash
curl "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/local/descriptions?ids=1520066f3f39496780c5931d9f7b26a6&ids=d00b153c719a427ea515f9eacf4853a2" \
  -H "X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

### Local POIs Parameters

The Local POIs endpoint (`/local/pois`) supports the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ids` (required) | array | Location IDs from the web search response (max 20) |
| `search_lang` | string | Search language preference (ISO 639-1, default: `en`) |
| `ui_lang` | string | UI language for response (e.g., `en-US`) |
| `units` | string | Measurement units: `metric` or `imperial` |

### Local Descriptions Parameters

The Local Descriptions endpoint (`/local/descriptions`) accepts only the `ids` parameter (same format as above, max 20).

For complete API documentation, see the [Local POIs API Reference](/api-reference/web/local_pois) and [Local Descriptions API Reference](/api-reference/web/poi_descriptions).

Note that the `id` fields of POIs are ephemeral and will expire after approximately 8 hours. Do not store them for later use.

## Rich Data Enrichments

Rich Search API responses provide accurate, real-time information
about the intent of the query. This data is sourced from 3rd-party
API providers and includes verticals such as sports, stocks, and
weather.

A request must be made to the web search endpoint with the query parameter `enable_rich_callback=1`.
An example cURL request for the query `weather in munich` is given below.

```bash
curl "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=weather+in+munich&enable_rich_callback=1" \
  -H "X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

The Web Search API response contains a `rich` field if the query is expected to return rich results. An example of the `rich` field is given below.

```json
{
  "rich": {
    "type": "rich",
    "hint": {
      "vertical": "weather",
      "callback_key": "86d06abffc884e9ea281a40f62e0a5a6"
    }
  }
}
```

The `rich` field of Web Search API response contains a `callback_key` field which can be used to fetch the rich results. An example cURL request to fetch the rich results is given below.

```bash
curl "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/rich?callback_key=86d06abffc884e9ea281a40f62e0a5a6" \
  -H "X-Subscription-Token: <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

### Supported Rich Result Types

The Rich Search API provides detailed information across multiple verticals, matching the query intent. Each result includes a `type` field (always set to `rich`) and a `subtype` field indicating the specific vertical.

Some of these providers will require attribution for showing this data.

## Headers

| Name | Location | Type | Required | Description |
|------|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `x-loc-lat` | header | string | No | The latitude of the client's geographical location in degrees,                 to provide relevant local results. The latitude must be greater                 than or equal to -90.0 degrees and less than or equal to +90.0 degrees. |
| `x-loc-long` | header | string | No | The longitude of the client's geographical location in degrees,                 to provide relevant local results. The longitude must be greater                 than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0 degrees. |
| `x-loc-timezone` | header | string | No | The IANA timezone for the client's device.             For complete list of IANA timezones and location mappings see [IANA Database](https://www.iana.org/time-zones)             and [Geonames Database](https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/). |
